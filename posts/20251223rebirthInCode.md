# 🍼 43 Years Old, But Only 100 Days Young: My Rebirth in Code

_Date: December 23, 2025 | Location: Maynooth, Ireland | Mood: Emotional & Unstoppable_

## The "Sieve" Moment

You know, I almost cried today. It sounds funny, right? A 43-year-old man getting emotional over a piece of Java code.

I was trying to write the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm—a method to find prime numbers. I didn't copy it. I didn't look at the textbook. For the first time, I wrote it from memory.

Was it perfect? No. It had bugs. I missed a logical condition, and I messed up an array index. But it was mine. It was the first time the logic flowed from my brain to my fingertips.


## The "Wobbly Toddler" Metaphor

Sitting there, fixing my bugs, it suddenly hit me. I thought of my little daughter.

She is still so small. She wobbles when she walks. Her vocabulary is limited to single syllables. But looking at her, I never worry. I never think, "Oh no, she’s failing." I just think, "She is growing. She is learning. One day, she will run."

I realized: I am just like her.

I landed in Ireland on September 7th. I started my first Java class on September 8th. Today is roughly day 106. In the world of coding, I am just a "100-day-old baby."

I stumble. I make syntax errors. I forget to handle the "0" and "1" edge cases. But just like my daughter, I am growing every single day. The possibility of my future is just as infinite as hers.


## The "Old Urchin" Spirit

People often ask, "Is it too late to switch careers at 43?"

Just the other day, I was talking to my landlady, Mary. We chatted for 20 minutes. I didn't show her my degrees or my bank account. I just told her my story—why I came here, why I code, and how I tackle problems. She trusted me immediately.

Why? Because even though I am a "beginner" in Java, I am a "veteran" in life. I bring 43 years of resilience, communication skills, and problem-solving experience to the table.

I call myself an "Old Urchin." I have the curiosity of a child and the wisdom of an adult.


## What's Next?

So, here I am. 106 days old in my new life. I fixed the bug in my Sieve algorithm today. Tomorrow, I’ll face a new algorithm, maybe a harder one.

It’s okay to wobble. It’s okay to fall. Because I know I’m walking forward.

Hello, World. I’m still loading, but I’m going to be a great program.

# 🍼 43 岁的年纪，100 天的新生：我在代码中的重生

_日期：2025 年 12 月 23 日 | 地点：爱尔兰·梅努斯 | 心情：激动且不可阻挡_

## “筛子”时刻

今天差点哭了，听起来有点好笑吧？一个 43 岁的男人，居然会因为一段 Java 代码而动情。

我在写埃拉托斯特尼筛法（Sieve of Eratosthenes）——用来找素数的算法。我没有抄，也没翻书。这是我第一次凭记忆写出来。

完美吗？当然不。里面有 bug，漏了一个逻辑条件，数组下标也写错了。但那是属于我的代码。第一次，思路从大脑流向了指尖。


## “蹒跚学步”的隐喻

坐在那里 debug 时，我突然想到我的小女儿。

她还很小，走路一摇一晃，词汇量只会发单音。但看着她，我从不担心她“失败”。我只会想：“她在成长，在学习，总有一天会奔跑。”

我突然明白：我和她其实一样。

9 月 7 日落地爱尔兰，9 月 8 日上第一节 Java 课。今天大约是第 106 天。对编程世界来说，我就是个“百天婴儿”。

我会摔跤，会写错语法，会忘记处理“0”和“1”的边界。但就像女儿一样，我每天都在成长。我的未来，和她一样，有无限可能。


## “老顽童”精神

很多人问，43 岁转行会不会太晚？

前几天和房东 Mary 聊了 20 分钟。我没给她看学历，也没秀存款，只是讲了自己的故事——为什么来这里，为什么学编程，怎么解决问题。她立刻信任了我。

为什么？因为我虽然是 Java 新手，但我是生活的老兵。我带着 43 年的韧性、沟通力和解决问题的经验来到这里。

我自称“老顽童”，有孩子的好奇心，也有成年人的智慧。


## 接下来呢？

现在的我，刚满“百天”。今天修好了筛法的 bug，明天会遇到新的算法，也许更难。

可以蹒跚，可以摔倒，因为我知道自己一直在向前。

Hello, World。我还在加载，但我一定会成为一段伟大的程序。
