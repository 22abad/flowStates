Since I have been here in Ireland for over a month, I am still adjusting to a different country, meeting different people, experiencing a new culture, and trying my best to become new.

It hasn't been an easy journey. Moving from the structured, precedent-based world of Law to the logic-driven, often abstract realm of Computer Science is a significant leap. In law, everything is open to interpretation; in code, a missing semicolon breaks everything.

However, being "new" is not only about all those things above. It relates more to my inner self and my actual feelings. I often find myself questioning my decisions, wondering if I'm on the right path. But then, I solve a complex problem, or finally understand a concept that eluded me for days, and the satisfaction is immense.

> The biggest change about me is my attitude to life. It's both because I am on a new land and because I am willingly making those changes.

This willingness to change is crucial. It's not just about learning Java or Python; it's about learning how to learn again. It's about being humble enough to ask questions and resilient enough to fail repeatedly until the code runs successfully.

The inner part plays a bigger role since I get more feedback when I am willing to be different—to say or do things that may never have been done before. I'm learning to embrace the uncertainty and find joy in the process of discovery.

Every day is a challenge, but also an opportunity. An opportunity to build something, to solve a puzzle, to create. And in this new land, with these new skills, I am slowly but surely building a new version of myself.

来爱尔兰已经一个多月了，我仍在适应这个不同的国家，遇见不同的人，体验新的文化，并尽力重塑自我。

这并不是一段轻松的旅程。从法律那个结构严谨、基于判例的世界，跨越到计算机科学这个逻辑驱动、往往抽象的领域，是一个巨大的飞跃。在法律中，一切都可以解释；而在代码中，一个漏掉的分号就能让一切崩溃。

然而，“新”不仅仅关于上述外在的一切。它更多地关乎我的内心自我和真实感受。我经常发现自己质疑自己的决定，想知道自己是否走在正确的道路上。但随后，我解决了一个复杂的问题，或者终于理解了一个困扰我几天的概念，那种满足感是巨大的。

> 我最大的改变是对生活的态度。这既是因为我身处这片新土地，也是因为我发自内心地愿意做出改变。

这种改变的意愿至关重要。这不仅仅是学习 Java 或 Python，而是关于重新学习如何学习。它是关于足够谦逊去提问，足够坚韧去一次又一次地失败，直到代码成功运行。

这种内在驱动力更为关键，因为当我主动寻求不同，去说或做以前可能从未做过的事时，我得到了更多的反馈。我正在学习拥抱不确定性，并在探索的过程中找到快乐。

每一天都是挑战，也是机遇。一个构建事物的机遇，一个解开谜题的机遇，一个创造的机遇。在这片新的土地上，带着这些新的技能，我正在缓慢但坚定地构建一个全新的自己。
