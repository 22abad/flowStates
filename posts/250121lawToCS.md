The Two-Month Shock Wave

I've been in Ireland for over two months now. To be honest, the first two weeks were a blur of confusion. Everything was new—the accent, the rhythm of life that felt both slower and strangely urgent. But I persisted. I held on.

1. The Death of the 'Genius' Identity

For a long time, I lived under the illusion of being 'smart,' believing true intelligence didn't require rigorous work. This pursuit of shortcuts led to an unsettling superficiality. The biggest breakthrough of this journey was finally admitting I am just an ordinary person.

"I realized that true competence isn't about being smart; it's about the consistent willingness to put in the work, every single day."

When I finally accepted that I needed to build a foundation from scratch, the actual building process became surprisingly light.

2. Rebirth in a New Environment

Coming to a new country and a new field was the ultimate reset button. I shed all past burdens and reputations. No one here knew my background in law, and no one expected brilliance in code. My conditions were basic, forcing me to start over and work flat-out to earn respect. This new anonymity was the perfect catalyst for a full commitment.

3. The Power of AI and Leverage

The transition would have been impossible without the power of Artificial Intelligence. AI didn't replace my learning; it served as a critical accelerator.

I was able to master Java fundamentals in a fraction of the traditional time.

I completed my first LeetCode pass in 40 days.

AI acted as a force multiplier to my pre-existing learning capability, allowing me to transform my ambition into real progress faster than ever before.

4. The Cornerstone of Family Support

I am incredibly fortunate to have a wife who is both intelligent and deeply loving. She is the quiet backbone of this entire operation, handling everything in Beijing.

"Her silent devotion and continuous faith are the non-negotiable fuel for my persistence. My duty to her is the clearest form of motivation."a

My effort is not just for myself; it’s my way of reciprocating her sacrifice and ensuring her belief in me is justified.

5. Finding Flow Through Public Accountability

Though the work is demanding, the days are profoundly fulfilling. I actively leverage social pressure to drive performance:

I publicly share my learning content and my study schedule with international classmates.

I often tell people I’m slow or 'a bit thick' (笨), which forces me to study harder than anyone else just to keep pace.

This constant public accountability is the final piece一个统要么运 puzzle, successfully 'forcing myself' into a high-intensity, high-reward state of flow.。在流动。
