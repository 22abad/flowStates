# The Two-Month Shock Wave: Finding Flow in a New Logic

## 1. The Shock of Starting Over
Arriving in Ireland felt like entering an entirely new universe. Every interaction, every sound of the streets, every cultural detail forced me to reshape myself. Transitioning from **Law**—a field built on precedent and ambiguity—into **Computer Science**, where logic rules without mercy, was a profound internal shock.

The first two weeks were chaotic. Everything was new—the accent, the rhythm, the routines. Slowly, patterns emerged and adaptation began.

## 2. The Death of the “Genius” Identity
For years, I believed smart people didn’t need to work hard. That belief created fragility more than strength. Ireland confronted me with repeated, small failures that forced a different lesson:

> **I am ordinary — and that is the starting point of real growth.**

Accepting ordinariness cleared the fog. It made learning a practice: small, daily, relentless.

## 3. Rebirth in a New Environment
A new country erases reputation. No one expects you to be anything; that lack of expectation is liberating. Anonymity let me rebuild from first principles.

## 4. The Power of AI and Leverage
AI didn’t remove effort. It amplified it.

- It compressed feedback loops.
- It highlighted mistakes quickly.
- It let me iterate much faster.

I mastered Java fundamentals in weeks, not months. I completed my first LeetCode pass in **40 days**. AI was a multiplier — not a crutch.

## 5. The Cornerstone of Family Support
This transition rests on one constant: my wife’s support. She manages so much back home, allowing me to focus. Her quiet faith is my non-negotiable fuel.

> **Her faith is fuel; my effort is the promise.**

## 6. Finding Flow Through Public Accountability
Sustained intensity requires systems. I use social structures to build them:

- I publicly share my study schedule.
- I share learning artifacts with classmates and peers.
- I openly admit my weaknesses (I say “I’m slow” or “a bit thick”) to reduce pride and raise the bar.

These actions create pressure. The sequence is intentional:

Pressure became clarity.  
Clarity became flow.

## 7. Becoming Someone New
Flow is not an escape — it's the scaffolding of transformation. Every problem, every late-night debugging session, every misunderstood concept becomes raw material for reinvention.

I am becoming someone new — more disciplined, more curious, more resilient.

**This is only the beginning.**

# 两个月的冲击波：在新的逻辑中找到心流

## 1. 重新开始的震荡
来到爱尔兰，就像进入另一个宇宙。每一次交流、每一条街道、每一种声音，都在把我从过去的自己拉出来，推向未来要成为的人。

从依赖判例与模糊性的**法律**，转向以逻辑为唯一语言的**计算机科学**，是一场彻底的震荡。

## 2. “天才”身份的死亡
多年里，我以为聪明的人不需要努力。爱尔兰用一次次失败逼我承认：我只是普通人。这份接受，是重建的起点。

> **我只是个普通人——真正的成长从这里开始。**

## 3. 在新环境中的重生
新的国家清零了过去的名声与期待，给予我匿名与自由，从头构建比迎合过去更轻松。

## 4. AI 与杠杆的力量
AI 并非捷径，而是放大器：

- 它压缩反馈回路；
- 它迅速暴露错误；
- 它帮助我更快迭代。

我在数周内掌握了 Java 基础，并在 **40 天** 内完成了第一次 LeetCode。

## 5. 家庭支持的基石
没有妻子的支持，这一切无法成立。她在北京承担了许多，给我安静的后方。

> **她的信任是燃料，而我的努力是回应。**

## 6. 在公开承诺中找到心流
为维持高强度，我采用外部机制：

- 公开我的学习计划；
- 与同学分享学习成果；
- 主动承认自己的不足（说“我很慢”或“我有点笨”）。

外部压力带来行动，行动带来清晰，清晰带来心流。

## 7. 成为新的自己
每一次困难都成为重塑的材料，我正在成为更自律、更好奇、更有韧性的人。

**这仅仅是开始。**
