# The Two-Month Shock Wave: Finding Flow in a New Logic

## 1. The Shock of Starting Over
Arriving in Ireland felt like being dropped into a new universe. Every sound, every street, every interaction pulled me out of who I was and into who I needed to become.

Transitioning from **Law**—a world built on precedent and ambiguity—to **Computer Science**, where logic rules without mercy, shook me deeply.

The first two weeks were chaos. Everything was new—the accent, the rhythm, the cold. But slowly, things began to settle.

The hardest part wasn’t the country.  
It was facing the truth of my own limitations.

---

## 2. The Death of the “Genius” Identity
For years, I clung to the illusion of being “naturally smart.” I believed real intelligence meant not needing effort.

Ireland destroyed that fantasy.

> **I am ordinary — and real growth begins there.**

Accepting ordinariness was the foundation I had avoided all my life.

---

## 3. Rebirth in a New Environment
A new country wipes your past.  
No reputation.  
No expectations.  
No history to lean on.

That anonymity became freedom.

I was forced to build everything from scratch — and that made the work lighter, not heavier.

---

## 4. The Power of AI and Leverage
AI did not reduce the work.  
It **amplified** it.

- Mastered Java fundamentals in weeks  
- Finished my first LeetCode pass in **40 days**

AI acted as a force multiplier — accelerating every learning cycle while exposing every weakness brutally and honestly.

---

## 5. The Cornerstone of Family Support
None of this transformation would be possible without my wife.

Her quiet competence keeps my world functioning.  
Her belief is my fuel.

> **Her faith is the non-negotiable engine behind my persistence.**

My progress is my promise to her.

---

## 6. Finding Flow Through Public Accountability
To force consistency, I created external pressure:

- Sharing my study schedule publicly  
- Telling classmates I’m slow or “a bit thick”  
- Using social accountability to keep myself in motion  

Pressure became clarity.  
Clarity became flow.

---

## 7. Becoming Someone New
Every difficult moment here becomes raw material for self-reinvention.

I am becoming someone new—disciplined, curious, resilient.

**This is only the beginning.**

# 两个月的冲击波：在新的逻辑中找到心流

## 1. 重新开始的震荡
来到爱尔兰，就像进入另一个宇宙。  
每一种声音、街道、互动，都在把我从过去的自己拉出来，推向未来要成为的人。

从依赖判例与模糊性的**法律**，转向以逻辑为唯一语言的**计算机科学**，是一场彻底的震荡。

最困难的不是环境，而是面对自己的真实限制。

---

## 2. “天才”身份的死亡
很多年来，我执着于“自己很聪明”这个幻觉，认为真正的聪明是不需要努力。

爱尔兰无情地击碎了这个幻想。

> **我只是个普通人——真正的成长从这里开始。**

接受平凡，是所有重建的基础。

---

## 3. 在新环境中的重生
来到一个新国家意味着过去清零。  
没有声望可以依靠，没有期待需要满足。

匿名性成为一种自由，让我得以从头开始构建自己。

---

## 4. AI 与杠杆的力量
AI 不是捷径，而是倍增器。

- 我在几周内掌握了 Java 基础  
- **40 天**完成第一轮 LeetCode  

AI 强迫我清晰、强迫我快速、强迫我诚实地面对弱点。

---

## 5. 家庭支持的基石
没有妻子，这一切都不会发生。

她在北京承担了所有压力，让我得以全身心投入。

> **她的信任是燃料，而我的努力是对她最清晰的回应。**

---

## 6. 在公开承诺中找到心流
为了维持高强度节奏，我主动制造外部压力：

- 公开分享学习进度  
- 主动告诉同学自己“有点笨”  
- 用社交杠杆锁住高频努力  

压力变成清晰，清晰变成心流。

---

## 7. 成为新的自己
在这里，每一个难关都是重塑自己的原材料。

我正在成为新的自己——更自律、更清晰、更坚毅。

**这仅仅是开始。**
