# Leveraging Emotional Intensity

## 1. The Myth of Emotional Flatness

I previously aspired to a state of stoic detachment—unshakable, calm, and emotionless regardless of the outcome.
I equated this with maturity and ultimate strength.
For years, I attempted to suppress extreme highs and conceal extreme lows, trying to conform to an image of stability.
However, I must admit: **This approach has failed.**

# 利用情绪强度

## 1. 情绪平稳的迷思

我以前渴望达到一种斯多葛式的超然状态——无论结果如何，都不可动摇、冷静且没有情绪。
我把这等同于成熟和终极力量。
多年来，我试图压抑极度的狂喜，掩盖极度的低落，试图符合一种稳定的形象。
然而，我必须承认：**这种方法失败了。**

## 2. Accepting High-Variance Performance

Conventional wisdom suggests making peace with one's flaws.
But I am not merely making peace with my inability to remain calm. **I am integrating it.**
"Steady as a rock" is not my operational mode.
If I solve a complex algorithm, I experience intense elation.
If I fail, I feel the weight of that failure acutely.
This volatility is not a bug; it is a feature. It is the turbocharger that powers 16-hour coding sessions. It is the intensity that drove me to Ireland when other avenues were closed.

## 2. 接受高方差表现

传统智慧建议与自己的缺点和解。
但我不仅仅是与我无法保持冷静这一事实和解。**我正在整合它。**
“稳如磐石”不是我的运作模式。
如果我解出了一个复杂的算法，我会体验到强烈的狂喜。
如果我失败了，我会敏锐地感受到失败的重量。
这种波动性不是 Bug，它是 Feature（特性）。它是驱动 16 小时编程会话的涡轮增压器。正是这种强度，在其他道路封闭时驱使我来到了爱尔兰。

## 3. Operational Rhythm

A flat line on an ECG indicates death. Life is defined by oscillation.
My oscillation simply has a higher amplitude than average.
Therefore, I am done pretending to be a low-humming appliance in the corner.
I am a high-performance engine that runs hot.
I do not require stability. I require **momentum**.
And currently, fueled by this intensity, my velocity is higher than ever.

## 3. 运作节奏

心电图上的直线意味着死亡。生命由振荡定义。
我的振荡只是比平均水平具有更高的振幅。
因此，我不再假装成角落里低声嗡嗡作响的电器。
我是一台发热的高性能引擎。
我不需要稳定性。我需要**动量**。
而现在，在这种强度的燃料驱动下，我的速度比以往任何时候都快。
