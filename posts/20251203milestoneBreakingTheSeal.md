# A Significant Step

Today marks a significant step in my learning process.
I solved a LeetCode Medium problem (BST to Greater Sum Tree) independently—without tutorials or hints.

For an experienced developer, this is routine. But for someone who started coding in October, it represents a shift from passive understanding to active problem-solving.
It has been a two-month journey of building foundations. I could follow logic before, but today I successfully translated that logic into code on my own.
It marks the transition from understanding the theory to applying it in practice.

# 重要的一步

今天是学习过程中的一个重要台阶。
我独立解决了一道 LeetCode Medium 题目（二叉搜索树转累加树），没有依赖教程或提示。

对于经验丰富的开发者来说，这是日常。但对于十月份才开始编程的人来说，这代表了从被动理解到主动解决问题的转变。
这是两个月打基础的成果。以前我能看懂逻辑，但今天我成功地将逻辑独立转化为代码。
这标志着从理解理论到实际应用的转变。

# 1. The Role of Repetition

Looking back at my earlier submissions, many were completed with guidance or by studying solutions.
At the time, it felt like I wasn't truly learning. However, I now realize that phase was essential.
Those guided attempts were about pattern recognition and syntax familiarity. They provided the necessary context for today's independent solution.
The contrast between "following along" and "doing it yourself" highlights the progress made. It validates the effort put into those initial, repetitive practice sessions.

# 1. 重复练习的作用

回顾早期的提交记录，很多都是在指导下或通过研究答案完成的。
当时感觉自己并没有真正学会。但我现在意识到，那个阶段是必不可少的。
那些引导式的练习是为了识别模式和熟悉语法。它们为今天的独立解题提供了必要的语境。
“跟随练习”与“独立完成”之间的对比，清晰地展示了进步的轨迹。这也验证了早期那些重复性练习的价值。

# 2. Intellectual Honesty

A key realization has been the importance of intellectual honesty.
It is easy to convince oneself that reading a solution is the same as understanding it.
Acknowledging the gap between "recognizing the code" and "writing the code" was crucial.
By admitting what I didn't know and focusing on the basics (even memorizing patterns initially), I built the confidence to eventually discard the training wheels.
True progress comes from accurately assessing one's own understanding.

# 2. 智识诚实

一个关键的感悟是“智识诚实”的重要性。
很容易让自己相信，看懂答案就等于掌握了知识。
承认“认得代码”和“写出代码”之间的差距至关重要。
通过承认自己的不足并专注于基础（甚至最初是背诵模式），我建立了最终摆脱辅助轮的信心。
真正的进步源于对自己理解程度的准确评估。

# 3. The First Step

There is a saying about the difficulty of the final stretch.
But in learning a new skill, often the hardest part is reaching the point of independent application.
Once you can solve one problem on your own, the path forward becomes clearer.
This isn't the end, but it's a valid start.

# 3. 坚实的起点

常言道“行百里者半九十”，强调最后的艰难。
但在学习新技能时，往往最难的是达到能够独立应用的那个点。
一旦能独立解决一个问题，前方的道路就变得清晰了。
这不是终点，而是一个坚实的起点。

In physics, **Static Friction** (the force needed to get an object moving) is always greater than **Kinetic Friction** (the force to keep it moving).
The anxiety before opening the IDE, the hesitation before stepping onto the cold train platform, the fear before the exam starts—that is the massive Static Friction.
Once you move, momentum takes over. The code writes itself. The exam answers flow.

Don't worry about the last 10 miles. Worry about the first step.
**Start, and you have already won.**

# 3. 反转古谚

中国有句古话叫“行百里者半九十”。它的意思是，事情越接近终点越艰难。

但今天，我意识到对于我们这些建设者来说，事实恰恰相反。
**真正开始的那一刻，其实你已经完成了 90%。**

在物理学中，**静摩擦力**（让物体动起来所需的力）永远大于**动摩擦力**（维持物体运动所需的力）。
打开 IDE 前的焦虑、踏上寒冷站台前的犹豫、考试开始前的恐惧——这些都是巨大的静摩擦力。
一旦你动起来了，惯性就会接管一切。代码会顺着指尖流淌，答案会自然浮现。

别担心最后那十里路。去担心第一步吧。
**只要开始，你就已经赢了。**
